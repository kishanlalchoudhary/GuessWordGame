# Guess Word Game 🎮

A console-based word-guessing game built with Ruby. The game challenges players to guess a hidden word within a limited number of attempts while providing real-time feedback on their progress. Developed using the **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology with RSpec for rigorous testing.

## Features 🚀

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Guess a word letter by letter with progress shown after every guess.
- **Dynamic Word Selection**: The game can randomly choose from a predefined list of words or allow a custom word.
- **Limited Attempts**: Players must guess the word within a set number of tries.
- **Real-Time Feedback**: Correctly guessed letters are revealed, while incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.
- **Test-Driven Development**: Designed and implemented using RSpec for robust and reliable code.

## Test-Driven Development 🧪

This project follows TDD principles with tests written in RSpec to validate game functionality. Key tests include:

- Validating word selection and hidden word display.
- Ensuring correct handling of guesses (correct and incorrect).
- Managing game over conditions (win or lose).
- Testing edge cases such as invalid input.
